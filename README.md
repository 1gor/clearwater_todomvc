# Clearwater TodoMVC

The [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) project has examples of various front-end frameworks implementing a to-do list. This is an example of one using [Clearwater](https://github.com/clearwater-rb/clearwater).

If you want to compile assets, make sure you run `rake assets:precompile` or start the app with `COMPILE_ASSETS=true rackup`.
